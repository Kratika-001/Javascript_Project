# Javascript_Project
This is a Project made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

In this project, a to-do app is made where tasks can be added, deleted, or marked as complete by clicking on the text (a line wil appear crossing the text).

There are also two buttons for calculator and weather.

Clicking on weather will redirect the user to a webpage which enables us to see the weather of any city around the world.

Clicking on the calculator button will redirect the user to a webpage which has the calculator.
