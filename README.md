# Javascript_Project
This is a Project that I made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
In this project, a to-do app is made where tasks can be added, deleted, or marked as complete by clicking on the text (a line wil appear passing through the text).
There is also a button which will redirect the user to a webpage which enables us to see the weather of any city around the world.
